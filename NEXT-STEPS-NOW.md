## 📋 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:**

### **STEP 1: Upload Files to Hostinger (10 minutes)**

**🔥 CRITICAL: Upload ALL contents of the `dist/` folder**

**📂 What to Upload:**
```
From: D:\Final CRM\5\dist\
To:   /public_html/ (your domain root on Hostinger)

Files to upload:
├── .htaccess          ← VERY IMPORTANT!
├── index.html         
├── favicon.ico        
├── robots.txt         
├── assets/            ← Entire folder
│   ├── main-B0Ha0DAZ.js
│   └── main-BlSjVpal.css
└── js/                ← Entire folder
    ├── grocery.js
    └── test-cors.js
```

**🚨 IMPORTANT:**
- Upload to `/public_html/` NOT a subfolder
- Make sure `.htaccess` is included (enable "show hidden files")
- Replace any existing files

### **STEP 2: Access Your Hostinger File Manager**

1. **Login to Hostinger Control Panel**
2. **Go to File Manager**
3. **Navigate to `/public_html/`**
4. **DELETE any existing index.html or files**
5. **Upload ALL files from your `dist/` folder**

```
