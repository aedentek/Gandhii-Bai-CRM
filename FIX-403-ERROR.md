# 🚨 403 FORBIDDEN ERROR - TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

## 🔍 **WHAT'S HAPPENING:**
- Your subdomain `crm.gandhibaideaddictioncenter.com` was created
- But showing "403 Forbidden - Access to this resource on the server is denied"
- This is a **permission/configuration issue**, NOT a code problem

---

## 🛠️ **IMMEDIATE FIXES TO TRY:**

### **FIX 1: Check Subdomain Folder**
1. **Go to Hostinger File Manager**
2. **Find your subdomain folder** - look for:
   - `/public_html/crm/`
   - `/public_html/subdomains/crm/`
   - Or check in your subdomain settings where it points

3. **Check if folder is EMPTY or has wrong files**
   - If empty: Upload your `dist/` files
   - If has other files: Delete them first, then upload `dist/` files

### **FIX 2: Upload Files Correctly**
**📂 Upload ALL these files to your subdomain folder:**
```
✅ index.html          ← MUST be present!
✅ .htaccess           ← Important for routing
✅ favicon.ico         
✅ robots.txt          
✅ assets/             ← ENTIRE folder
   ├── main-B0Ha0DAZ.js
   └── main-BlSjVpal.css
✅ js/                 ← ENTIRE folder
   ├── grocery.js
   └── test-cors.js
```

### **FIX 3: Check File Permissions**
In Hostinger File Manager:
1. **Right-click on `index.html`**
2. **Choose "Permissions" or "CHMOD"**
3. **Set to 644** (rw-r--r--)
4. **For folders, set to 755** (rwxr-xr-x)

### **FIX 4: Default Document Settings**
1. **Go to Hostinger Control Panel**
2. **Find "Subdomain Management" or "Domain Settings"**
3. **Check if `index.html` is set as default document**
4. **If not, add it or change it**

## 🔧 **STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION:**

### **STEP 1: Verify Subdomain Folder**
1. Open **Hostinger File Manager**
2. Navigate to your subdomain folder
3. **Take a screenshot** of what's currently in there
4. **Delete everything** in that folder

### **STEP 2: Upload Fresh Files**
1. Upload **ALL** files from `D:\Final CRM\5\dist\`
2. Make sure **`index.html`** is in the root of subdomain folder
3. Enable "Show hidden files" to upload `.htaccess`

### **STEP 3: Set Permissions**
1. **Files:** Set to 644
2. **Folders:** Set to 755
3. **`.htaccess`:** Set to 644

### **STEP 4: Check Subdomain Settings**
1. Go to **Subdomain Management** in Hostinger
2. **Verify the subdomain points to correct folder**
3. **Check if SSL is enabled** for the subdomain

## 🎯 **WHAT SHOULD BE IN YOUR SUBDOMAIN FOLDER:**

```
/public_html/crm/ (or your subdomain folder)
├── index.html          ← THIS IS CRITICAL!
├── .htaccess           
├── favicon.ico         
├── robots.txt          
├── assets/
│   ├── main-B0Ha0DAZ.js
│   └── main-BlSjVpal.css
└── js/
    ├── grocery.js
    └── test-cors.js
```

## 🚨 **COMMON CAUSES OF 403 ERROR:**

1. **No `index.html`** in subdomain folder
2. **Wrong file permissions** (should be 644)
3. **Subdomain pointing to wrong folder**
4. **Empty folder** with no files
5. **`.htaccess` blocking access** (but ours should be fine)

---

## 📞 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

1. **Check what's currently in your subdomain folder**
2. **Delete everything and upload fresh `dist/` files**
3. **Ensure `index.html` is in the root**
4. **Set correct permissions**

**Once you do this, the 403 error should be resolved!**

**The issue is with file upload/permissions, not with our code!** 🔧
