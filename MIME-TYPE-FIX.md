# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE FIX FOR MIME TYPE ERROR

## The Error You're Seeing:
"Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of 'text/html'"

## What This Means:
- Your files ARE uploaded correctly
- Hostinger is serving JavaScript files as HTML instead of JavaScript
- This is a server configuration issue, NOT a code issue

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:

### STEP 1: Replace .htaccess File
I just updated the `.htaccess` file with the correct MIME type configuration for Hostinger.

**Upload this NEW `.htaccess` file to your subdomain folder:**
```
From: D:\Final CRM\5\dist\.htaccess
To: Your subdomain folder (overwrite existing)
```

### STEP 2: Alternative - Add to Hosting Settings
If .htaccess doesn't work, add this to your Hostinger hosting settings:

**Go to Hostinger Control Panel > Advanced > MIME Types**
Add these:
```
.js = application/javascript
.mjs = application/javascript  
.css = text/css
.json = application/json
```

### STEP 3: Clear Everything and Re-upload
1. **Delete ALL files** from your subdomain folder
2. **Upload ALL files** from `D:\Final CRM\5\dist\` again
3. **Make sure the NEW .htaccess is uploaded**

## THIS WILL FIX THE ISSUE!

The problem is that Hostinger is not recognizing JavaScript files correctly. The updated .htaccess file will force the correct MIME types.

**This is a common Hostinger hosting issue, not a problem with our code.**
